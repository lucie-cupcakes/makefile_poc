This is a proof of concept on how to
create a program using only a Makefile.

The example program is built and run inside a container.

Make sure you are connected to the internet, and that you have docker.

Simple run make.

Our example program is a hello world made with inline x86_64 Linux assembly,
also it is not linked to any kind of library, not even clib!

- Enjoy.
