This program is a proof of concept on how to create
only a Makefile insted of a lot of files.

All the tools needed for building our program are done within a container.

Simple run make.

Make sure you are connected to the internet, and that you have docker.

The program is a hello world made with inline x86_64 assembly.
That also is not linked to any kind of library, not even clib!

- Enjoy.
